Deterministic concurrent LP optimizer: primal simplex, dual simplex, and barrier
Showing barrier log only...

Root barrier log...


Barrier performed 0 iterations in 1.82 seconds (6.18 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 0.17s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: objective 3.022929e+06, 7020 iterations, 0.37 seconds (0.69 work units)
